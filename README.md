# pbtutils
A function libary written in R to parse Pygmy Bluetongue (PBT) behaviour observations, approach/retreat distance observations and environmental observations for subsequent statistical analysis.

To use this library, clone or download into your R Studio Project folder.  
`pbtutils.r'` is the function libary, access it like as a 'local package', eg
```r
# Load PBT data import functions from file
source("pbtutils.r")
```
An example run for observational data scored in Solomon Coder is provided (*without* supporting data files) as [DataPreparation_2024.r].
